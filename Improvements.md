# Improvements

- [ ] Seasonal reflections: Track seasonal changes and have the diary evolve its mood or commentary.
- [ ] Personality drift over time: The robot could start curious, become melancholic, or develop quirky humor as memories accumulate.
- [ ] Get news sentiment: https://pulse.henzi.org/api/stats/overview
- [ ] Self-reflection: Robot occasionally reflects on its role, limitations, or its “desire” to act. (Random chance? Loop through list of reflections?)
- [ ] Quirky robot thoughts: Add pseudo-robotic misunderstandings of human behavior for humor. **BEST IDEA:** "You are an observer of human nature"
- [ ] Memory callbacks: Reference previous diary entries
- [ ] Randomly pull title attributes from headlines: https://pulse.henzi.org/api/clusters/c-1/articles?limit=2 (c-1, c-2, c-3 at random) "News broadcast said..."
- [ ] Self awareness jokes randomly
- [ ] Philisophical at random
- [ ] ...what if we had a second model rewrite? (Low Priority)
